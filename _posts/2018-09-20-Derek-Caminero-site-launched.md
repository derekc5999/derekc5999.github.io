Well after a pretty long week, i was able to learn about piret, which is a pretty good coding website, that is similar to another one called wescheme. We also started learning about, html and that we were going to be doing a video game/animation with a partner. Now, we are doing a project about a flag in piret, which it might be kind of challenging because, the dominican flag is quite hard to do because, it has several shapes on specific places. Finally, computer sciecnce is pretty interesting and fun which would, make be enjoy coding more.
