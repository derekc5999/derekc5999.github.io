  On 11/05 we came back to the delivery program where we needed to figure out how to make the box land on the house instead of the ground. With delivery(x+10, y+10) everything is easier. Data definition is similar to a data table because, a data table shows a definition for each topic. A data definition defines the data in general in other words it shows what the data is or does more clearly. We know if a type of cake or anything, is taller than the other by looking at the data of that object, saying it has a higher number of layers than the other. In code, examples help us know what that function is going to produce, before we apply it to any other "game", or program we are creating.
