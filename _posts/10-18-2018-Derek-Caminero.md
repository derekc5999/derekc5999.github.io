  Not being able, to use put-image, and needing to use, place-image normally, makes it more complex for use learners to not only use one type of function. I was able now to use overlay-xy to make the parts of the dominican flag, which it is a really easy way to make different images. Also, we learned to put an image on top of each other and make a different image than usual. In otherwords we can use more than two different images to make one, that is similar to a collage. I am actually glad that we in this school are learning about computer science without, we needing to be in a club, or take after school classes.
